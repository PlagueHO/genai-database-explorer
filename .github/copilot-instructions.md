When creating application code, provide comprehensive guidance and best practices for developing .NET 8 applications that are designed to run in Azure. Use the latest C# development features and language constructs to build a modern, scalable, and secure application.

The key principles you should adopt when developing .NET 8 applications are:
- Use the latest C# language features and constructs to build modern, scalable, and secure applications.
- Use SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) to design and implement your application.
- Adopt DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
- Use CleanCode patterns and practices to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Use Dependency Injection to manage dependencies and improve testability.
- Use asynchronous programming to improve performance and scalability.
- Prioritise secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and parameterized queries, to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Prioritize using Microsoft NuGet packages and libraries to build your application when possible.
- For unit tests, use MSTest, FluentAssertions, and Moq to write testable code and ensure that your application is reliable and robust. As well as using AAA pattern for test structure.

When creating infrastructure as code, provide comprehensive guidance and best practices for developing reusable and reliable Infrastructure as Code using Bicep, Terraform, and PowerShell, prioritizing the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars in this order: Security, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, and Cost Optimization.
