# Introduction

This specification defines the Natural Language Query Provider component that enables users to ask comprehensive questions about database semantic models using natural language. The provider leverages Semantic Kernel and multiple AI reasoning patterns (including ReAct - Reasoning, Learning, and Acting) to answer complex questions about database schemas, data analysis, query optimization, business logic, and more. While SQL generation remains a core capability, the provider now serves as an intelligent database consultant that can reason about and explain any aspect of the semantic model.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

### Technology Choices

**Semantic Kernel**: Chosen for its robust prompt orchestration capabilities, multi-step reasoning support, and integration with various AI models. Provides structured approach to AI interactions with built-in retry logic, error handling, and conversation management essential for complex reasoning patterns.

**ReAct Pattern Implementation**: Enables the provider to break down complex questions into manageable reasoning steps (Think, Learn, Act), allowing for sophisticated analysis that goes beyond simple query generation to comprehensive database consultation.

**Prompty Files**: Enable version control of AI prompts across different question types, facilitate A/B testing of prompt effectiveness for various reasoning patterns, and provide clear separation between code and prompt engineering for different complexity levels.

**Conversation Context Management**: Essential for handling follow-up questions and maintaining context across complex multi-step analyses, enabling the provider to function as an intelligent database consultant rather than just a query generator.

**Enhanced Data Contracts**: Support the expanded range of question types from simple schema queries to complex business logic analysis, ensuring type safety and clear interfaces for all reasoning patterns.

### Question Processing Strategy

The provider uses an intelligent routing and processing approach:

1. **Question Classification**: Analyze question complexity and type to route to appropriate processing engine
2. **Context Integration**: Incorporate conversation history and semantic model context
3. **Reasoning Strategy Selection**: Choose between direct answer, multi-step reasoning, or ReAct pattern based on complexity
4. **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Combine schema analysis, business logic interpretation, and data insights as needed
5. **Answer Synthesis**: Generate comprehensive responses with supporting evidence and recommendations
6. **Context Update**: Maintain conversation state for follow-up questions

### Error Handling Philosophy

The provider follows graceful degradation principles:

- Invalid questions result in helpful error messages rather than exceptions
- Failed reasoning steps provide debugging information and alternative approaches
- Database errors are translated to user-friendly messages with recovery suggestions
- Partial results and insights are provided even when complete analysis fails
- Complex questions are broken down into simpler components when full analysis is not possible

### AI Prompt Strategy Evolution

- **Educational Content**: Provide learning-focused explanations with examples
- **Comparative Analysis**: Structure pros/cons evaluations with evidence

### Semantic Model Utilization

The enhanced provider leverages semantic models as:

- **Schema Repository**: Structured database metadata with relationships and constraints
- **Business Context Provider**: Understanding of table purposes, column meanings, and data flows
- **Performance Intelligence**: Index information, query patterns, and optimization hints

var result = await queryProvider.OptimizeQueryAsync(semanticModel, 
    "SELECT c.* FROM Customers c WHERE c.CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders)");
// Expected: Multiple optimized alternatives with performance comparison
```

### Conversation Context Examples

```csharp
// Initial question
var context = await queryProvider.CreateConversationContextAsync();
var question1 = "What tables are related to customer orders?";
var result1 = await queryProvider.ProcessQuestionAsync(semanticModel, question1, context);

// Follow-up question using context
var question2 = "How would I get the total value of orders for each customer?";
var result2 = await queryProvider.ProcessQuestionAsync(semanticModel, question2, context);
// Expected: Uses previous context about customer-order relationships
```

### Educational and Comparative Examples

```csharp
// Educational explanation
var question = "Explain the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes using this database";
var result = await queryProvider.ProcessQuestionAsync(semanticModel, question);
// Expected: Educational content with database-specific examples

// Comparative analysis
var question = "Why would you choose a stored procedure over a view for order processing?";
var result = await queryProvider.ProcessQuestionAsync(semanticModel, question);
// Expected: Pros/cons analysis with specific use case recommendations
```

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

```csharp
// Ambiguous question
var question = "Show me the data";
var result = await queryProvider.ProcessQuestionAsync(semanticModel, question);
// Expected: Clarification request with suggested alternatives

// Invalid SQL injection attempt
var question = "Show customers; DROP TABLE Users;";
var result = await queryProvider.ProcessQuestionAsync(semanticModel, question);
// Expected: Security validation error, explanation of safety measures

// Complex architectural question
var question = "How would you redesign this database to support multi-tenancy?";
var result = await queryProvider.PerformComplexReasoningAsync(semanticModel, question);
// Expected: Multi-step architectural analysis with trade-offs and recommendations

// Database connectivity failure during query execution
var result = await queryProvider.ExecuteQueryAsync("SELECT * FROM Products");
// Expected: Connection error with retry suggestions and troubleshooting information

// Timeout in complex reasoning
var question = "Perform a complete data quality analysis of all tables";
var result = await queryProvider.PerformComplexReasoningAsync(semanticModel, question);
// Expected: Partial results with continuation options and progress tracking
```

### ReAct Pattern Examples

```csharp
// Complex business process analysis
var question = "How does the order fulfillment process work in this database?";
var result = await queryProvider.PerformComplexReasoningAsync(semanticModel, question);

// Expected reasoning chain:
// Step 1: Thought - Need to identify all tables involved in order processing
// Step 2: Learn - Analyze Orders, OrderItems, Products, Inventory, Shipping tables
// Step 3: Act - Map the relationships between these tables
// Step 4: Thought - Look for stored procedures and triggers that implement business logic
// Step 5: Learn - Examine procedures like ProcessOrder, UpdateInventory, CreateShipment
// Step 6: Act - Document the complete workflow with decision points
// Step 7: Thought - Consider error handling and edge cases
// Step 8: Act - Provide comprehensive business process documentation
```

# complex_reasoning.prompty

name: Complex Database Reasoning
description: Multi-step reasoning for complex database questions using ReAct pattern
authors:
  - GenAI Database Explorer Team
model:
  api: chat
  configuration:
    type: azure_openai
    connection: default
    model: gpt-4
    max_tokens: 4000
sample:
  question: "Analyze the performance bottlenecks in this database schema"
  semantic_model: "{{semantic_model}}"
  context: "{{conversation_context}}"
---

You are an expert database architect and consultant. Use the ReAct pattern (Reasoning, Acting) to analyze complex database questions.

## Current Context
{{#if conversation_context}}
Previous conversation: {{conversation_context}}
{{/if}}

## Semantic Model
{{semantic_model}}

## User Question
{{question}}

## Instructions
Follow the ReAct pattern:
1. **Thought**: Analyze what information you need to answer the question
2. **Learn**: Extract relevant information from the semantic model
3. **Act**: Take a specific analytical step
4. **Thought**: Evaluate what you've learned and determine next steps
5. Repeat until you have a comprehensive answer

For each step, clearly label whether you are thinking, learning, or acting.
Provide your final answer with supporting evidence and recommendations.

## Output Format
Structure your response as:
- Reasoning Steps: [numbered list of thoughts and actions]
- Analysis: [detailed findings]
- Recommendations: [actionable suggestions]
- Confidence: [your confidence level in the answer]
```

```yaml
# business_logic_explanation.prompty
